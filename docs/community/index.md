## Types of Contributions

### Report Bugs

Submit an issue at [https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-app-rdm/issues](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-app-rdm/issues).
Select bug and you will have a prepopulated GitHub issue created for you.
Fill it out!

InvenioRDM is made up of a collection of modules. As you become more familiar with them,
you may want to submit your ticket to their respective repositories. You can see all the repositories at <https://github.com/inveniosoftware/> .

### Ask For a Feature

Read through the already opened [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/product-rdm/discussions), or [invenio-app-rdm issues](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-app-rdm/issues). You can also ask on [Discord](https://discord.gg/8qatqBC). Create one if you don't find a ticket that represents the feature you would like.

When proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)

### Fix Bugs

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug"
is open to whoever wants to implement it.

Follow our [development process](code/process.md) (also summarized in the module's `CONTRIBUTING.md` file) to ensure you are adhering to our approach.

Indicate you are working on the bug in the [Community PR board](pr-community-board.md).

### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "good first issue"
is a good place to start. Otherwise, reach out on the [chat](https://discord.gg/8qatqBC) and ask.

Just as for fixing bugs, follow our [development process](code/process.md) for the practical details.
And similarly, indicate what you are working on in the [Community PR board](pr-community-board.md).

### Write Documentation

InvenioRDM could always use more documentation, whether as part of these
official docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

### Translate InvenioRDM

InvenioRDM is used all over the world, but is not yet translated into all languages.
You can make InvenioRDM even more accessible by joining the translation team
and helping with translations. Follow the [translation guide](translations/translators-guide.md).
